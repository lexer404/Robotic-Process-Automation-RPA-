## Summary
This repo is about a project on RPA. Links might not work/be done as hosting is stopped.

## Prerequisites
Make sure the necessary software is installed on your computer before you start:
- Microsoft Excel
- UiPath Studio (Version: Please select the version you're using)

## Usage Guidelines
With its intuitive interface, this automation makes it easier to work with different tables. The project can be used as follows:
1. Credential Input: - A pop-up will ask for your email address and password when the automation runs. This method prevents passwords from being stored in the code, ensuring security.
2. Table Selection: - Following the submission of your credentials, a second pop-up window will show up letting you select which table (Orders, Order Details, Products, Customers) you wish to work with. This flexibility lets you concentrate on individual tables, which saves time.
3. Logging In: â€“ After that, the automated will log in with the supplied credentials.
4. Table Communication:
    - After logging in, the page for the chosen table will be displayed to you.
    - You will be able to add, modify, and remove entries using the pop-up that appears after.
5. Adding Entries: Clicking "Add" will cause the table to immediately update with all the required information (rows).
6. Editing Entries: The first row will be editable if "Edit" is selected.
7. Deleting Entries: Selecting "Delete" will immediately remove all entries (rows), and Excel will record "TRUE" in the "Result" column to show that the deletion was successful.
